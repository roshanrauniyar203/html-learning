        Ram Shah (Nepali: राम शाह; reign before 1606 – 1636) was a king of the
        Gorkha Kingdom (present-day Gorkha District, Nepal). He was the son of
        Gorkha king Purna Shah and brother of Chatra Shah. He acceded to the
        throne c. 1606 after his brother's death. He expanded his kingdom as far
        as the Trishuli River to the east, the Marshyangdi to the west, the
        Rasuwa to the north, and the Mahabharat Range to the west.
